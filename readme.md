FAQ:
GSAS (General Structure Analysis System) is a comprehensive system for the refinement of structural models to both x-ray and neutron diffraction data.
GSAS has been created by Allen C. Larson and Robert B. Von Dreele of Los Alamos National Laboratory.
GSAS (and EXPGUI) are no longer maintained or supported. We are recommending that people switch to use of GSAS-II which provides all the features of GSAS/EXPGUI, and much more and does many of the same things much better.
